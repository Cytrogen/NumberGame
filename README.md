# NumberGame

- 1st Big Project
- A trivial game that deals with manipulations of numbers and should not be played
- Rules are all specified in the program (the instant you see it you will quit the program)
- Type: Console gaming, with (horrible) text animations
- Bad practice with all those logics in Main class, please avoid this practice when you code
- 不要靠近，会变得不幸 (Google translate is not reliable, you just have to know that this is a warning)
